![IMG-7493](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99901227/192418604-fa7b4416-5bb5-422d-860e-7d55432e4f99.jpg)

Issues with current Implementation:
- Button layout: It is not organized in a way that is convenient for user and buttons are out of order
- Current floor screen is too high from interface and so far up that it is out of view in image

Good Factors not to be changed:
- Emergency call and other tool buttons are seprated from the group of floor buttons
- Room under symbols for brailles

Commmon uses:
- Avoid stairs
- Necessary for heavy/large objects to be towed one floor to another
- Faster transportation from one floor to the next

Common Sequence of Action:
- Press button of destinated floor
- Look at screen to insure you chose the right floor
- Exit elevator at designated floor
